It basically just shows you different numbers on hover.

# Why?
Because some greedy little ... put up this exact plugin on the jetbrains marketplace <b>PAID</b>
which is a really scummy move.
My opinion is that these little "helper" plugins <b>SHOULD NOT BE</b> a monthly subscription. 
This is just ludicrous! Why the duck do people think this is okay?

# How?

Hovering over these numbers will show you the number in decimal, binary, octal and hex.:

```
0x123
0b101
0o123
123
```

You can also toggle this on and off. Default is <b>OFF</b> just search for the action "Toggle Hover Number Conversion".

It display it like this:
